<!-- Hi Heather, I tried to use C3 to create this graph because I cannot figure out how to use double Y axes in combination graph in Google Charts. 

I had a question when I was making this: it's about if I should invert the Y-axis value for the ranks. Because smaller the number is, better the rank is. If I don't invert it, readers would feel that the ranking is getting worse, which is the oppoiste. So I really want to know what you would handle this problem. Thank you so much!-->
